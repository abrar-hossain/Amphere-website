            <h4>Mamun Rashid founded Greece in 2008 and since then Bilkis Jahan has been in charge of all activities in Bangladesh. Mamun Rashid came to Texas Tech University, USA on 08-08-08 to do his PhD. During the voyage, everything including the initial activities of the Greek and the design of the website were drafted within the plane. For the first few months, all of Greece's activities were limited to distributing free information on the Web site. At the time, the Greek name was GRE Center and all information was distributed through a website called grecenter.net. Mamun does all the work on the website from the USA, including Greek course development and making lecture sheets, and Bilkis Jahan manages everything from course management, marketing and human resource control in Bangladesh. The rhythmic organization of these two people was the main driving force behind the introduction and business success of the Greeks. The Greeks started their journey as a one-room sublet in an institution near Jigatla in Dhaka. The number of Greek students in the first three months was zero. But since the beginning of the first batch, our dedication, sincerity and knowledge of the quality of the course has gradually increased and word of our pioneer has spread from the traditional style coaching center. Our main marketing tool was "Word of Mouth" which means the flow of information from our own students to others. Logo and name:</h4>
